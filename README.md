Prototype of React95, a small Windos 95 recreation using ReactJS

Not much you can do at the moment but open blank debug windows that you can drag, drop, stack and close

There is a bug when dragging and dropping files and windows. 
The dragged element will hang onto the cursor when dropped with the cursor outside of the HTML element bounds.
To avoid it just make sure the cursor is within the icon image or the headbar of a window when letting go of the mouse.
If it hangs on to your cursor just click again and it will let go.

I will fix it once i finish adding the minimize and resize window features
